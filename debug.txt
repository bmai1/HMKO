- Infinite Clerk redirect loop? 
    - Cause: outdated version
    - npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
    - npm install @clerk/nextjs
    - As of Jul 16, 2024: react 18.3.1 , clerk/nextjs ^4.31.3

- PlanetScale (prisma, MySQL) free tier deprecation
    - Migrate to PostgreSQL (neondb) 
    Prisma commands:
    - npx prisma db pull -> pulls tables created manually from provider via sql editor (neon)
    - npx prisma migrate dev --name add_cascade_delete -> sync prisma/schema.prisma with neon db

- npm update: otherwise weird css behavior
    - GET /_next/static/css/app/index.css.map 404 in 525ms

Error occurred during query execution:
ConnectorError(ConnectorError { 
    user_facing_error: None, kind: QueryError(PostgresError { 
        code: "42704", 
        message: "type \"public.ChannelType\" does not exist", 
        severity: "ERROR", 
        detail: None, column: None, hint: None 
    }), transient: false 
})

- This was because I used a separate ChannelType in the SQL schema model for Channel instead of using Enum separately.
    - Manually create TYPE 
    - On channel/server delete cascade
    - Just revert to original schema, don't trust GPT


- Server sidebar not updating after creation/deletion of servers
    - Fix: window.location.reload() with form (server button) submission
